			<h2>Documentation</h2>
			<p>I currently work as a tech writer at Atlassian. Contrary to popular belief, I actually write very little technical documentation.
				Instead, my primary focus is making our software easier to understand.</p>
			<p>Some of what this includes is being involved in the design process, planning how information is surfaced, writing UI copy,
				participating in customer research, speaking with our customers on forums to understand their challenges and answer their
				questions, and writing both official documentation and other content around best practices.</p>
			<p>*Because of the CMS we use, a lot of the official Atlassian documentation that I write doesn't have my name on it because
				it uses the name of the person who initially created that version of the docs.</p>

					<h3>Organize Your Space</h3>
					<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/organize-your-space-827106212.html" target="_blank">
						<p>One of the biggest issues that customers brought up in user testing was that deciding how to organise content within
							Confluence caused a lot of anxiety.</p>
						<p>Confluence is highly customizable, and there wasn't much content available instructing users on the best way to do
							this - so I spoke to a number of users to understand their differing needs, and then created this.</p>

							to create different content types.</p>
						<p>Despite not sitting inside the main documentation, this page has still been highly popular, even after the experiment
							ended.

			<h2>Articles</h2>
			<p>Back when I was younger I did a lot of writing about music, arts, and events for various music publications and city guides.</p>
			<p>I also had a stint as a sub-editor at Purple Sneakers, which involved writing a high volume of articles with sometimes
				less than an hour of turnaround time.</p>
			<p>I would, additionally, edit other writers' work and published them on our blog, which was built on Wordpress, and I rewrote
				our writing guidelines.

			<h2>Random other things I've written</h2>
			<p>I occassionally wrote a few pieces for university magazines, to submit to competitions, and for various other little things
				where there were either prizes or payment in the form of free things.</p>
			<p>I was young, and they'd always tell you 'You can use this in your portfolio!'</p>
			<p>I'd like to mention that I once won first, second, and third prize in the Dorothea Mackellar poetry competition. No, I
				was not the only entrant.</p>
			<p>I also, on two occassions, wrote into magazines, and both times I won 'Letter of the Month'.</p>
			<p>One was Sunday Life, for which I won $1000 worth of prizes, while the other was Travel 3Sixty, which won me a non-transferable
				voucher that could only be used at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.</p>
			<p>As I'd just left Malaysia and the value of the voucher was less than the cost of a ticket back, this voucher, sadly, never
				got used.</p>
